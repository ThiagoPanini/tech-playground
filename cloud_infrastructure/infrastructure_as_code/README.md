# Infrastructure as Code

Explore Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools and practices for managing cloud infrastructure through declarative configuration files. Automate infrastructure provisioning and management.

## IaC Tools

### Terraform
- **Core Concepts** - Providers, resources, modules, state management
- **Configuration** - HCL syntax, variables, outputs, locals
- **State Management** - Remote state, state locking, workspaces
- **Modules** - Reusable infrastructure components
- **Planning & Deployment** - Terraform plan, apply, destroy workflows

### CloudFormation (AWS)
- **Templates** - JSON/YAML infrastructure definitions
- **Stacks** - Infrastructure deployment units
- **Parameters & Outputs** - Template customization
- **Nested Stacks** - Modular template composition
- **StackSets** - Multi-account and multi-region deployment

### ARM Templates (Azure)
- **Template Structure** - Parameters, variables, resources, outputs
- **Linked Templates** - Modular deployment patterns
- **Template Specs** - Template versioning and sharing
- **Bicep** - Domain-specific language for ARM templates

### Cloud Deployment Manager (GCP)
- **Configuration Files** - YAML-based infrastructure definitions
- **Templates** - Python and Jinja2 template support
- **Deployments** - Infrastructure management units

### Alternative Tools
- **Pulumi** - Multi-language infrastructure as code
- **CDK** - AWS Cloud Development Kit
- **Ansible** - Configuration management and orchestration
- **Chef/Puppet** - Configuration management platforms

## Infrastructure Patterns

### Multi-Environment Management
- Environment-specific configurations
- Variable management strategies
- Workspace and state isolation
- Promotion workflows

### Modular Architecture
- Reusable module development
- Module versioning and registry
- Composition patterns
- Dependency management

### Security & Compliance
- Secret management and encryption
- Policy as code with tools like Open Policy Agent
- Compliance scanning and validation
- Least privilege access patterns

## Best Practices

### Code Organization
- Directory structure and naming conventions
- Module design principles
- Version control and branching strategies
- Code review and collaboration

### State Management
- Remote state storage and security
- State file encryption and backup
- Concurrent access prevention
- State migration strategies

### Testing & Validation
- Infrastructure testing frameworks
- Policy validation and compliance
- Cost estimation and optimization
- Disaster recovery testing

## CI/CD Integration

### Pipeline Automation
- Automated infrastructure deployment
- Infrastructure validation and testing
- Rollback and disaster recovery
- Multi-environment promotion

### GitOps Workflows
- Git-based infrastructure management
- Pull request workflows for changes
- Automated drift detection
- Continuous compliance monitoring

## Structure

- `terraform/` - Terraform configurations and modules
- `cloudformation/` - AWS CloudFormation templates
- `arm-bicep/` - Azure ARM and Bicep templates
- `pulumi/` - Pulumi infrastructure examples
- `modules/` - Reusable infrastructure modules
- `policies/` - Policy as code implementations
- `testing/` - Infrastructure testing strategies
- `pipelines/` - CI/CD pipeline configurations

## Getting Started

1. Choose the appropriate IaC tool for your platform
2. Set up version control and collaboration workflows
3. Design modular and reusable infrastructure components
4. Implement proper state management and security
5. Establish testing and validation practices
6. Automate deployment through CI/CD pipelines
