# Monitoring

Implement comprehensive monitoring, observability, and alerting solutions for modern applications and infrastructure. Build robust monitoring systems for production environments.

## Observability Pillars

### Metrics
- **Time-series Data** - Performance metrics, business KPIs, system health
- **Aggregation Strategies** - Counters, gauges, histograms, summaries
- **Collection Methods** - Pull-based (Prometheus) vs push-based systems
- **Visualization** - Dashboards, charts, and real-time displays

### Logging
- **Structured Logging** - JSON, key-value pairs, consistent formats
- **Log Aggregation** - Centralized log collection and processing
- **Log Analysis** - Search, filtering, and pattern recognition
- **Log Retention** - Storage policies and archival strategies

### Tracing
- **Distributed Tracing** - Request flow across microservices
- **Span Management** - Operation tracking and timing
- **Trace Sampling** - Performance optimization strategies
- **Service Maps** - Dependency visualization and analysis

## Monitoring Stack Components

### Metrics Collection
- **Prometheus** - Time-series database and monitoring system
- **InfluxDB** - Time-series database for IoT and real-time analytics
- **Graphite** - Scalable real-time graphing system
- **StatsD** - Network daemon for statistics collection

### Visualization
- **Grafana** - Analytics and interactive visualization platform
- **Kibana** - Data visualization for Elasticsearch
- **Chronograf** - InfluxDB's visualization layer
- **Custom Dashboards** - Application-specific monitoring interfaces

### Logging Solutions
- **ELK Stack** - Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana
- **EFK Stack** - Elasticsearch, Fluentd, Kibana
- **Loki** - Horizontally scalable log aggregation system
- **Splunk** - Platform for searching and analyzing machine data

### Tracing Systems
- **Jaeger** - End-to-end distributed tracing
- **Zipkin** - Distributed tracing system
- **AWS X-Ray** - Application performance monitoring
- **Google Cloud Trace** - Distributed tracing service

## Application Monitoring

### Application Performance Monitoring (APM)
- **New Relic** - Full-stack observability platform
- **Datadog** - Monitoring and analytics platform
- **AppDynamics** - Application performance monitoring
- **Dynatrace** - AI-powered observability platform

### Error Tracking
- **Sentry** - Error tracking and performance monitoring
- **Rollbar** - Real-time error tracking
- **Bugsnag** - Error monitoring and reporting
- **Honeybadger** - Exception and uptime monitoring

### Synthetic Monitoring
- **Uptime Monitoring** - Website and API availability checks
- **Performance Testing** - Load testing and user experience monitoring
- **Transaction Monitoring** - Critical user journey verification

## Infrastructure Monitoring

### System Metrics
- **Node Exporter** - Hardware and OS metrics for Prometheus
- **Collectd** - System statistics collection daemon
- **Telegraf** - Agent for collecting metrics and data
- **SNMP Monitoring** - Network device monitoring

### Container Monitoring
- **cAdvisor** - Container resource usage and performance
- **Kubernetes Metrics** - Pod, node, and cluster monitoring
- **Container Insights** - Cloud-native container monitoring

### Cloud Monitoring
- **AWS CloudWatch** - Monitoring and observability service
- **Google Cloud Monitoring** - Infrastructure and application monitoring
- **Azure Monitor** - Full-stack monitoring solution

## Alerting & Incident Management

### Alert Management
- **Alertmanager** - Alert routing and management for Prometheus
- **PagerDuty** - Incident response platform
- **Opsgenie** - Modern incident management
- **VictorOps** - Incident response and collaboration

### Alert Strategies
- SLA/SLO-based alerting
- Anomaly detection and machine learning
- Alert fatigue prevention
- Escalation policies and on-call rotation

## Structure

- `prometheus/` - Prometheus monitoring configurations
- `grafana/` - Dashboard and visualization examples
- `logging/` - Centralized logging implementations
- `tracing/` - Distributed tracing setups
- `alerting/` - Alerting rules and configurations
- `apm/` - Application performance monitoring
- `infrastructure/` - Infrastructure monitoring patterns
- `cloud/` - Cloud-specific monitoring solutions

## Best Practices

- Implement the four golden signals (latency, traffic, errors, saturation)
- Design alerts based on user impact, not just symptoms
- Use service level indicators (SLIs) and objectives (SLOs)
- Implement proper data retention and storage policies
- Plan for monitoring system reliability and redundancy
- Document runbooks and incident response procedures
