# AI Agents

Explore the development of autonomous AI agents and multi-agent systems. Learn to build intelligent agents that can perceive, reason, and act in complex environments.

## Agent Types

### Reactive Agents
- Simple reflex agents
- Model-based reflex agents
- Goal-based agents
- Utility-based agents

### Cognitive Agents
- Learning agents
- Reasoning agents
- Planning agents
- Multi-modal agents

### Conversational Agents
- Chatbots and virtual assistants
- Task-oriented dialogue systems
- Open-domain conversation agents
- Voice-enabled agents

## Multi-Agent Systems

### Coordination Patterns
- Distributed problem solving
- Negotiation and auction mechanisms
- Consensus algorithms
- Swarm intelligence

### Communication
- Agent communication languages (ACL)
- Message passing protocols
- Shared knowledge bases
- Coordination mechanisms
