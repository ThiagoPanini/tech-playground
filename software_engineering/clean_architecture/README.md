# Clean Architecture

Clean Architecture is a software design philosophy that emphasizes separation of concerns and dependency inversion. This folder contains examples and implementations of clean architecture principles.

## Core Principles

- **Independence of Frameworks**: The architecture doesn't depend on external libraries
- **Testability**: Business rules can be tested without UI, databases, or external elements
- **Independence of UI**: The UI can change without changing the business logic
- **Independence of Database**: Business rules are not bound to the database
- **Independence of External Agency**: Business rules don't know about the outside world

## Structure

- `examples/` - Practical implementations in different programming languages
- `patterns/` - Specific clean architecture patterns and templates
- `docs/` - Additional documentation and architectural decision records

## Getting Started

1. Review the core principles and concepts
2. Explore language-specific examples
3. Implement your own clean architecture project
4. Document architectural decisions and patterns
