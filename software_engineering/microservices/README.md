# Microservices

Explore microservices architecture patterns, implementations, and best practices. Learn how to design, build, and manage distributed systems effectively.

## Core Concepts

- Service decomposition strategies
- Inter-service communication (REST, gRPC, messaging)
- Data management and consistency patterns
- Service discovery and load balancing
- Circuit breakers and resilience patterns
- Distributed tracing and monitoring

## Architecture Patterns

- **API Gateway** - Single entry point for client requests
- **Service Mesh** - Infrastructure layer for service-to-service communication
- **Event-Driven Architecture** - Asynchronous communication through events
- **CQRS** - Command Query Responsibility Segregation
- **Saga Pattern** - Managing distributed transactions
- **Bulkhead Pattern** - Isolating resources to prevent cascading failures

## Structure

- `examples/` - Complete microservice implementations
- `communication/` - Inter-service communication patterns
- `data-patterns/` - Data management strategies
- `deployment/` - Containerization and orchestration
- `monitoring/` - Observability and monitoring solutions

## Technologies

- Containerization: Docker, Kubernetes
- Communication: REST, gRPC, Apache Kafka, RabbitMQ
- Service Discovery: Consul, Eureka, Kubernetes DNS
- Monitoring: Prometheus, Jaeger, Zipkin, ELK Stack

## Getting Started

1. Start with a simple service decomposition example
2. Implement basic inter-service communication
3. Add monitoring and observability
4. Explore advanced patterns like event sourcing and CQRS
