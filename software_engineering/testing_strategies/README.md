# Testing Strategies

Comprehensive exploration of software testing methodologies, frameworks, and best practices. From unit tests to end-to-end testing strategies.

## Testing Pyramid

### Unit Tests
- Fast, isolated tests for individual components
- Test-driven development (TDD) practices
- Mocking and stubbing strategies
- Code coverage analysis

### Integration Tests
- Testing interactions between components
- Database integration testing
- API integration testing
- Message queue and event testing

### End-to-End Tests
- Full user journey testing
- Browser automation and UI testing
- Performance and load testing
- Cross-browser and cross-platform testing

## Testing Types

- **Functional Testing** - Verifying business requirements
- **Performance Testing** - Load, stress, and volume testing
- **Security Testing** - Vulnerability assessment and penetration testing
- **Accessibility Testing** - WCAG compliance and usability
- **Contract Testing** - API contract verification (Pact, Spring Cloud Contract)
- **Chaos Testing** - Resilience and fault tolerance testing

## Testing Frameworks & Tools

- **Unit Testing** - JUnit, pytest, Jest, Mocha, RSpec
- **Integration Testing** - TestContainers, WireMock, Postman
- **E2E Testing** - Selenium, Playwright, Cypress, Puppeteer
- **Performance Testing** - JMeter, k6, Gatling, Artillery
- **API Testing** - Postman, REST Assured, Supertest
