# Design Patterns

This section explores classic and modern design patterns - reusable solutions to common problems in software design. Implementations in various programming languages with practical examples.

## Categories

### Creational Patterns
- Singleton, Factory, Builder, Prototype, Abstract Factory

### Structural Patterns  
- Adapter, Decorator, Facade, Composite, Proxy, Bridge, Flyweight

### Behavioral Patterns
- Observer, Strategy, Command, State, Template Method, Chain of Responsibility, Mediator, Memento, Visitor, Iterator

### Modern Patterns
- Dependency Injection, Repository, Unit of Work, CQRS, Event Sourcing, MVC/MVP/MVVM

## Structure

- `creational/` - Creational pattern implementations
- `structural/` - Structural pattern implementations  
- `behavioral/` - Behavioral pattern implementations
- `modern/` - Modern and architectural patterns
- `anti-patterns/` - Common anti-patterns to avoid

## Getting Started

1. Choose a pattern category that interests you
2. Study the problem each pattern solves
3. Review implementation examples
4. Practice implementing patterns in your preferred language
5. Understand when to use (and when not to use) each pattern

## Best Practices

- Don't force patterns where they're not needed
- Understand the trade-offs of each pattern
- Consider simpler solutions before applying complex patterns
