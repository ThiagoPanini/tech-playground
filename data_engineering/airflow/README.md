# Apache Airflow

Explore Apache Airflow for workflow orchestration and data pipeline management. Learn DAG development, task management, and operational best practices.

## Core Concepts

### DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs)
- Workflow definition and structure
- Task dependencies and relationships
- Scheduling and execution policies
- DAG configuration and parameters

### Operators
- Built-in operators for common tasks
- Custom operator development
- Sensor operators for external events
- Transfer operators for data movement

### Executors
- Sequential, Local, and Celery executors
- Kubernetes and Docker executors
- Scaling and parallelization strategies

## Advanced Features

- **XComs** - Cross-communication between tasks
- **Hooks** - Interface with external systems
- **Connections** - Managing external service credentials
- **Variables** - Global configuration management
- **Branching** - Conditional workflow execution
- **Sub-DAGs** - Modular workflow composition
- **TaskGroups** - Logical task grouping

## Best Practices

### DAG Design
- Idempotent tasks design
- Proper error handling and retries
- Resource allocation and limits
- Testing and validation strategies

### Operations
- Monitoring and alerting setup
- Log management and debugging
- Performance tuning and optimization
- Backup and disaster recovery
