# tech-playground
üéÆ A technical playground for building and testing solutions across software engineering, data engineering, AI/ML, cloud infrastructure, and DevOps.

## Overview

This repository serves as a comprehensive learning and experimentation platform for developers working across different technology domains. Each folder represents a specific area of expertise with practical examples, patterns, and best practices.

## Repository Structure


### üîß [Software Engineering](software/)
Modern software development practices and architectural patterns
- **[Vertical Slice Architecture](software/vertical_slice_architecture/)**: Complete implementation of vertical slice architecture for B3 stock ticker extraction, demonstrating clean architecture principles with feature-based organization, web scraping, AWS infrastructure (Terraform), and comprehensive testing.

### üìä Data Engineering
*Coming soon: Robust data pipelines and processing systems*

### ü§ñ AI & Machine Learning
*Coming soon: Artificial intelligence and machine learning implementations*

### ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud & Infrastructure
