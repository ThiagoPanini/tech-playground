# Data Storage

This section explores various data storage solutions, architectures, and best practices for different data types and use cases. From traditional databases to modern data lake architectures.

## Topics Covered

- **[Databases](databases/)** - SQL and NoSQL database implementations and patterns
- **[Data Warehousing](data_warehousing/)** - Data warehouse design, implementation, and best practices
- **[Data Lakes](data_lakes/)** - Data lake architectures, governance, and management

## Getting Started

Explore different storage solutions based on your data requirements and use cases. Each subfolder provides practical examples and implementation guides.

## Database Types

Coverage includes various database paradigms:
- Relational databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite)
- Document databases (MongoDB, CouchDB)
- Key-value stores (Redis, DynamoDB)
- Graph databases (Neo4j, Amazon Neptune)
- Time-series databases (InfluxDB, TimescaleDB)
- Column-family (Cassandra, HBase)

## Use Cases

Examples for different scenarios:
- OLTP (Online Transaction Processing)
- OLAP (Online Analytical Processing)
- Real-time analytics
- Data archiving and retention
- Multi-tenant architectures
