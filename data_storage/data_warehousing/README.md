- **Data Lake Integration** - Combining structured and unstructured data
- **Serverless Computing** - Event-driven data processing
- **Microservices** - Decoupled data processing services

### Lambda Architecture
- **Batch Layer** - Comprehensive and accurate batch processing
- **Speed Layer** - Real-time processing for low-latency requirements
- **Serving Layer** - Query interface for both batch and real-time data

### Kappa Architecture
- **Stream Processing** - Everything is treated as a stream
- **Event Sourcing** - Immutable event log as source of truth
- **Real-time Analytics** - Continuous processing and analysis
