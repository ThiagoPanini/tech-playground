# Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)

## ADR-001: Use Vertical Slice Architecture

### Status
Accepted

### Context
We need to organize our codebase in a way that promotes feature independence, reduces coupling, and makes it easier for teams to work on different features simultaneously.

### Decision
We will organize our code using Vertical Slice Architecture, where each feature contains all the code it needs to function independently.

### Consequences
**Positive:**
- Features can be developed independently
- Reduced coupling between features
- Easier to understand and test individual features
- Better alignment with business requirements

**Negative:**
- Some code duplication may occur
- Need to carefully manage shared concerns
- Learning curve for developers new to this pattern

## ADR-002: Use MediatR for Request/Response Handling

### Status
Accepted

### Context
We need a clean way to separate controllers from business logic and enable cross-cutting concerns.

### Decision
We will use MediatR to implement the mediator pattern for handling requests and responses.

### Consequences
**Positive:**
- Clear separation between HTTP concerns and business logic
- Easy to add cross-cutting concerns through behaviors
- Testable handlers
- Consistent request/response pattern

**Negative:**
- Additional dependency
- Learning curve for developers not familiar with MediatR

## ADR-003: Minimize Shared Code

### Status
Accepted

### Context
We need to balance code reuse with feature independence.

### Decision
We will minimize shared code and prefer duplication over coupling when it promotes feature independence.

### Consequences
**Positive:**
- Features remain independent
- Changes to one feature don't affect others
- Easier to refactor individual features

**Negative:**
- Some code duplication
- Need to be careful about shared business rules
