# Software Engineering

This section contains explorations and implementations of software engineering principles, patterns, and best practices. Here you'll find practical examples and experiments related to building robust, maintainable, and scalable software systems.

## Topics Covered

- **[Vertical Slice Architecture](vertical_slice_architecture/)** - Complete implementation of vertical slice architecture for B3 stock ticker extraction, demonstrating clean architecture principles with feature-based organization

## Current Implementation

### Vertical Slice Architecture
A comprehensive example showing how to structure an application using vertical slice architecture, featuring:
- Clean separation of concerns across domain, application, and infrastructure layers
- Feature-based organization where each slice contains all necessary components
- Web scraping implementation for financial data extraction
- AWS infrastructure deployment with Terraform
- Comprehensive testing strategy

## Getting Started

Each subfolder contains its own README with specific instructions and examples. Start with the [Vertical Slice Architecture](vertical_slice_architecture/) to see a complete implementation of modern software architecture patterns.

## Contributing

Feel free to add new examples, improve existing code, or suggest new software engineering topics to explore. When contributing:
- Follow the established architectural patterns
- Include comprehensive documentation
- Add appropriate tests
- Consider infrastructure requirements
