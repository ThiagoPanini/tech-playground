# Software Engineering

This section contains practical explorations and implementations of software engineering principles, patterns, and best practices. Find examples and experiments for building robust, maintainable, and scalable systems.

## Topics Covered

- **[Vertical Slice Architecture](vertical_slice_architecture/)**: Complete implementation for B3 stock ticker extraction, demonstrating clean architecture, feature-based organization, web scraping, AWS infrastructure (Terraform), and comprehensive testing.

## Current Implementation

### Vertical Slice Architecture
A comprehensive example showing:
- Clean separation of concerns (domain, application, infrastructure)
- Feature-based organization (each slice contains all necessary components)
- Web scraping for financial data extraction
- AWS infrastructure deployment with Terraform
- Comprehensive testing strategy

## Getting Started

Each subfolder contains its own README with instructions and examples. Start with [Vertical Slice Architecture](vertical_slice_architecture/) for a complete implementation of modern software architecture patterns.

## Contributing

Feel free to add new examples, improve existing code, or suggest new topics. When contributing:
- Follow the established architectural patterns
- Include comprehensive documentation
- Add appropriate tests
- Consider infrastructure requirements
